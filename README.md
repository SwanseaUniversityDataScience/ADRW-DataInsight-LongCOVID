## üìù Project description

This study investigates clinical coding of Long COVID recorded in primary and secondary care for the population of Wales to aid in understanding the coding quality, variation of use in primary care software systems, completeness and useability of data.
Furthermore, this study provides a comprehensive characterisation of patients clinically diagnosed with Long COVID, aiming to build a deeper understanding of this relatively new condition.

## üìÉ Funding

This research has been carried out as part of the ADR Wales programme of work, as part of the Major Societal Challenges thematic research area. The thematic research areas align with the priority themes identified in the Welsh Government‚Äôs Programme for Government. ADR Wales brings together data science experts at Swansea University Medical School, staff from the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research and Data (WISERD) at Cardiff University and specialist teams within the Welsh Government. It develops new evidence which supports the Programme for Government by using the SAIL Databank at Swansea University to link and analyse anonymised data. ADR Wales is part of ADR UK, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (part of UK Research and Innovation).
